# Graphic-Design-Application

An application created in Python using the Pygame graphics library and the Math module. This is a graphic design application reminiscent of 
Microsoft Paint; it allows users to make use of features such as paintbrush, shapes, a polygon tool, undo/redo functions, spray paint, color picker, an
eraser tool, backgrounds, stickers and a feature to save the art that you have created. This was created as a project over the course of a month for the ICS3U course that I took in high school.
